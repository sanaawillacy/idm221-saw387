## Company History
In February 2001, Dolphin Cove opened its doors just across the road from Dunn’s River Falls in Ocho Rios. Originally the Burrows' family home, it was transformed into a three-acre marine park with initially four dolphins as the star attractions and since then, has undoubtedly risen to become the country’s leading tourism attraction.

Just 4 years later in 2005, Half Moon Dolphin Lagoon became the second Dolphin Cove park, right at the heart of the Half Moon Resort, becoming a one of a kind attraction exclusive to their guests. In 2010 Dolphin Cove Montego Bay (previously Dolphin Cove Negril) opened the door of its 23 acre of ocean frontage for all their visitors and finally in 2015 Dolphin Cove settled the 4th park in Jamaica at Moon Palace Jamaica Grande, another wonderful location exclusive for the hotel’s guests.

After fifteen years in the business, Dolphin Cove has developed into a dynamic attraction offering a plethora of activities for visitors to do. Increasingly, more and more visitors are zooming into this unique adventure, and the reviews have been nothing less than great! This is evidenced by the numerous local and international awards we have won including the most recent, Jamaica Hotel & Tourist Award for the Attraction of the Year 2013.
